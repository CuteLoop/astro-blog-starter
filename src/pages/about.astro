  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>
  <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>

    {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
      <li>
        Two of my hobbies are {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}.
      </li>
    )}
  </ul>

  <p>
    I like working on problems that sit somewhere between math, code, and real
    life. Sometimes that looks like research, sometimes teaching, and sometimes
    it’s just experimenting with ideas to see what breaks (and why).
  </p>

  <p>My skills are:</p>

  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => (
      <li class="skill">{skill}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>

  {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
  {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}
  {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
